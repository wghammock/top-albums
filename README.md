## About ******** Back End Challenge

In a fictional world, we are branching into the music business and need to develop an API to
retrieve the different albums we want to showcase on our website. We can leverage the iTunes
album library to help populate our own inventory.

## Base Requirements For All Levels

Create an API endpoint that can retrieve the top 100 albums based on the json feed here:
https://itunes.apple.com/us/rss/topalbums/limit=100/json

• A clean & modern RESTful API architecture for retrieving the top 100 albums
• Clean, readable, maintainable codebase
• Code can be written in any language, but preferably in PHP
• Host source code on GitHub
